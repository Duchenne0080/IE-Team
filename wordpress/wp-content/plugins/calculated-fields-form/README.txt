Calculated Fields Form is a plugin for creating forms with dynamically calculated fields and display the result.

== Description ==

Calculated Fields Form is for visually:

    ♦ Creating forms with automatically calculated fields
    ♦ Finance calculators
    ♦ Quote calculators
    ♦ Booking cost calculators
    ♦ Date calculators
    ♦ Health / fitness calculators
    ♦ Form builder for adding input fields on the form
    ♦ Add one or more calculated fields
    ♦ Predefined forms templates

With Calculated Fields Form you can create **forms with dynamically calculated fields** to **display the calculated values**.

It includes a **form builder** for adding/editing different field types, including one or more **automatically calculated fields** based in the data entered in other fields.

Calculated Fields Form can be used for creating both single and complex calculations, for example general calculators, ideal weight calculators, calorie calculators, calculate quotes for hotel booking and rent a car services, calculate quotes for appointments and services, loan & finance calculators, date calculators like pregnancy calculators, etc...

= Features: =

* Visual **form builder** with multiple fields and form formatting options
* Any number of **calculated fields** can be added
* Easy and visual calculator interface
* The calculator supports both easy and advanced operations, including ternary operators and common Math functions
* Supports **multiple field types**, like drop-down, checkboxes, radiobuttons, dates, numbers
* Accept operations with dates (ex: days between two dates)
* Smart automatic number and prices identification into the field values
* Supports form separators and comments sections to layout the form in a friendlier way
* Manage multiple calculated forms
* Practical "clone" button to duplicate a form
* Five pre-built practical samples included
* Multi pages forms supported
* Conditional rules supported. Useful for creating wizards
* Intuitive and interactive form builder interface
* Predefined forms templates

The "Calculated Fields Form" plugin allows the specific integration with the following editors:

* Classic WordPress Editor.
* Gutenberg Editor.
* Elementor.
* Page Builder by SiteOrigin.
* Beaver Builder.
* WPBakery Page Builder.
* DIVI Builder.
* For other editors, the shortcodes should be inserted using other controls of general purpose, like the controls for inserting HTML or shortcodes.

= Latest Features Added =

* Dependent fields: Fields can be shown/hidden based on other checkboxes, radiobuttons or drop-down selections
* Dependent fields from calculated values: Fields can be shown/hidden based on the value of a calculated field
* Throubleshoot area to automatically fix conflicts with other scripts on themes or third party plugins and also for special characters support
* Multi page calculated forms
* New validations, fields types and features in the form builder
* Calculated fields can be hidden fields.
* Includes new controls to create more versatile forms.
* Allows to create a cache of the javascript files to increase the website's performance.
* Allows to disable the forms when the website is visited by search engine spiders and crawlers, increasing the website's speed.

There are five samples already included with the installation:

1. Simple Calculator Operations
2. Calculation with Dates (bookings with check-in and check-out dates)
3. Ideal Weight Calculator
4. Pregnancy Calculator
5. Lease Calculator

You can either "**clone**" those calculated forms to complete your own form or create a new calculated form from scratch for your application.

You can **mix text and numbers** into a field. If a field contains a number it will be automatically identified and used for the calculations. In addition to that, the checkboxes, radio buttons and drop-down fields can have separately a visual "text" and a hidden "value" linked to each test: the value will be the one used for the calculation.

The dates are also automatically identified and you can apply operations between them, for example, you can calculate the **number of days between two dates** with a simple operation like "date2-date1" or add some number of days or weeks to a date. To display the result as a date again you can use the CDate operator included in the calculator. The samples #2 and #4 are practical samples.

The form processing and payment processing aren't included in this version. There are other versions with form processing included and additional features. See the FAQ for more information.

== Other Notes ==

This section contains mainly notes about the form builder features that are too long to explain in the main description page.

= Conditional Rules =

The form fields can be shown or hidden depending of the selection made on checkboxes, radio-buttons, select/drop-down, and calcualted fields.

[Description about the use of dependencies](http://cff.dwbooster.com/features/dependant-fields "Description about the use of dependencies")

= Predefined value =

The fields can have "predefined" or "prefilled" values. There are two possible uses for this:

1- Can be used for pre-filling the form with common values and save time to the end user.

2- Can be used for showing a sample of the data that should be entered in the field. In this case you may want to mark also the checkbox "Hide predefined value on click", this way the value will disappear once the user starts using the field without having to manually delete the placeholder value.


= The "Instructions for User" option =

Each field has a settings value labeled "Instructions for User". Use that settings value to put instructions to the end user about filling that field. The instructions will appear in a smaller text immediately below the field in the public website.

= Add Css Layout Keywords =

This is also explained in the FAQ. The "Add Css Layout Keywords" is a way to apply CSS styles separately for each field. This settings field is available for each form builder field in the admin area. Into that field you can put the name of a CSS class that will be applied to the field.

Important: Put only the name of the CSS class into the "Add Css Layout Keywords"; don't put the css styles rules directly there.

There are some pre-defined CSS classes to use align two, three or four fields into the same line. The CSS classes are named:

    column2
    column3
    column4

For example if you want to put two fields into the same line then specify for both fields the class name "column2". The above is valid for both the classic fields and the calculated fields.

The CSS classes/rules can be placed into the file "wp-content\plugins\calculated-fields-form\css\stylepublic.css" or into your theme CSS files.


= Multi Page Forms =

For adding a new page to create multi-page forms just insert the field named "Page Break". Each form's page will be validated separately before going to the next form, however note that the calculations are applied to the whole form every time a field is modified, so a calculated field in other page may be modified even if that page isn't visible.


= Calculated "hidden" Fields =

The calculated fields can be "hidden" fields. This way the calculated values of those "hidden" fields won't be displayed in the form. This is useful for using intermediate calculated values or for showing the calculated values only into the email (pro version).


= Equations / formulas Format for Calculated Fields =

Here are some sample formulas that can be used as base:

* With simple mathematical operations:


    `fieldname1 + fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 * fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 / fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`



* With multiple fields and fields grouping included:


    `fieldname1 * ( fieldname2 + fieldname3 )`



* Rounded to two decimal digits:


    `prec( fieldname2 / fieldname3 , 2)`



* There is a huge number of equations that can't be recreated with simple mathematical operators, or the operations listed above, requiring "IF" conditions, here is a sample of the formula that can be used in that case:

    `(function(){`
    `        if(fieldname3 > 100) return fieldname1+fieldname2;`
    `        if(fieldname3 <= 100) return fieldname1*fieldname2;`
    `})();`


* For complex equations where is required to define blocks of JavaScript code, you should use the following format:

    `
    (function(){`
        `    var calculatedValue = 0;`
        `    //Your code here`
        `    return calculatedValue;`
    `})();`


.... and note that the **return** value of that function will be the value assigned to the calculated field.


= Functions that can be used for the formulas =

In addition to the JavaScript functions, the following functions can be used directly into the formulas:

In addition to the above, the following operations that are available in the **Developer** and **Platinum** versions of plugin:

To get the complete list of available fields, please visit the following link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#common-fields "Available fields")

= Create JavaScript variables to be used in the equations, from GET, or POST parameters, SESSION variables, or COOKIES =

The icon with the "X" symbol, that appears when editing the contents of pages or posts, inserts a shortcode in the content with the structure:

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="..."]`

The ... symbol should be replaced by the parameter or variable name, and will be the same name of the javascript variable. For example:

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="varname"]`

= Tips for calculating prices =

One of the most frequent uses is for calculating prices. When displaying prices a good you may want to divide the form in two pages, the first one for asking the information needed to calculate the price and in a second page display the calculated field with the price and using the "Instruct. Text" fields for adding the terms, conditions and valid time for the price.

Note that you can make the "Instruct. Text" fields dependent from the calculated value, that way you can change the text shown to the user depending of the number shown in the calculated price, since frequently the terms, conditions or offers vary according to the price amount.
