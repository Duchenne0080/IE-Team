== Upgrade notice ==
On settings page load, the .htaccess file is no rewritten. If you have made .htaccess customizations to the RSSSL block and have not blocked the plugin from editing it, do so before upgrading.
Always back up before any upgrade. Especially .htaccess, wp-config.php and the plugin folder. This way you can easily roll back.
